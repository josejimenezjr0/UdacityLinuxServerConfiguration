# Udacity Linux Server Configuration

I will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host my web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.

I've installed PostgreSQL to serve the database information for the Item Catalog web app. I've also installed Python along with all the Python dependencies for the web app. And I've installed Apache to be the web server.
